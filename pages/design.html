    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
    <a href="../index.html" class="return-home">Return to Homepage</a>
    <p>Here are just a few of my favorite graphic design projects from my career. Over the past 5 years, 
        I've created art for brands including Duke Athletics, Ballislife, and various clientele in the NBA and NCAA. 
        My full portfolio can be found at this <a href="https://www.behance.net/rohantummala" target="_blank" class="external" >link. </a></p>

                    created for the 7uice foundation, founded by Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics, was shown on an NBC10 Boston news segment during the 2024 NBA Finals.
